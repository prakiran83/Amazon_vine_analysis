# Amazon_vine_analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon vine program. Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. In other words, it is a paid for program for consumers to use the product and leave, hopefully favorable, reviews about the product. For this project, I chose to analyze the data for video games reviews.

## Results

There are 51% reviews with 5 star rating compared to 39% of non-vine reviews.

## Summary
By analyzing the numbers and stats, I have come to the conclusion that the Vine program for the product is not necessary. Although the 51% of 5 star reviews by the vine customers might seem like a positive bias, the 39% of 5 star reviews from non-vine customers can be assumed as a solid foundation for the product's viability and popularity amongst the real customers.
